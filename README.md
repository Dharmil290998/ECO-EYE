## Project Overview

EcoEye Bird Monitoring System project aims to develop an advanced system for bird species
identification, population analysis, and data visualization. The project leverages deep
learning techniques, data analysis, and web development to create a comprehensive
solution for monitoring bird populations.
The objective of the wildlife monitoring system is to employ image recognition technology to
accurately identify and track diverse species across different habitats and timeframes. This
entails achieving high accuracy in species identification, ensuring consistent tracking, and
detecting rare species. Additionally, the system aims to provide comprehensive displays of
tracked species, their locations, population trends, and environmental impact assessments,
facilitating informed conservation decisions.
